\begin{itemize}
%\item Collaborated with Lawrence Livermore National Lab on a proposal for a synergistic loop scheduling and load balancing strategy. 
%\item Worked on making User-defined Loop Scheduling portable across different parallel programming library, done with Oak Ridge National Lab through DoE Exascale Computing Program. 
%\item Added examples of loop scheduling in OpenMP in the Examples section of OpenMP Specification.
%\item Worked on a NSF startup SBIR proposal for loop scheduling for desktop computers. 
%\item Collaborated on developing a proposal to add an OpenMP User-defined Schedule to the OpenMP specification based on an OpenMPCon 2017 paper, presenting a proposal at the OpenMP F2F in Santa Clara and the upcoming F2F in Toronto.
\item Did research and development for User-defined Loop Schedules in OpenMP.
%\item Assisted with slides for pitch and marketing of Charm++ software, and providing feedback for tutorials on Charm++.
\item Integrated a shared memory library for sophisticated loop scheduling strategies, including some based on my dissertation, into the current version of Charm++. 
%item Comparing performance of a loop scheduling strategy available in the integrated shared memory library with the performance of the corresponding loop scheduling strategy available in LLVMâ€™s OpenMP library.
